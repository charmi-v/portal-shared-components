## useSnackbar

<Canvas of={SnackbarStories.SnackbarExample} />

#### Details

The useSnackbar hook provides a simple and efficient way to trigger snackbars in your React application.

It leverages a singleton pattern to manage snackbar notifications globally, ensuring that snackbars can be displayed from any component without requiring explicit wrapping or context.

This hook is especially useful in scenarios where you want to trigger a user notification (e.g., success, error, warning) in response to events like form submissions, API responses, or user interactions.

Additionally, the hook supports customizable snackbar options such as message, severity, duration, and more as provided by the existing PageSnackbar component.

#### Prerequisites:

**Global Initialization:** Ensure that GlobalSnackbarContainer is properly initialized in your application root, so that the useSnackbar hook can function as expected.
typically in your index.tsx or App.tsx.

```jsx

import { GlobalSnackbarContainer, SharedThemeProvider } from '@catena-x/portal-shared-components'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <SharedThemeProvider>
      <App />
      <GlobalSnackbarContainer/>
   </SharedThemeProvider>
)
```

#### Usage

```jsx
import { useSnackbar } from '@catena-x/portal-shared-components';

const ExampleComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { showSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  const handleError = () => {
    showSnackbar({
      message: 'This is an error message!',
      severity: 'error',
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
     <Button variant="contained" color="secondary" onClick={handleError}>
        Show Error Snackbar
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
};
export default ExampleComponent;
```
